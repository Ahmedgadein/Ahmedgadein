Hi, I'm a 21 y.o Sudanese **Android Developer** from Khartoum. Mainly, I'm into native Android development (Java/Kotlin) and cross development in Flutter. Love the Dopamine that comes from solving bugs :smile:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter, UX Design, and Information Architecture design
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Android projects with social impact
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to native Android / Flutter
